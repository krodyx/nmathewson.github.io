You can find my contact information and an incomplete list of some of
the projects I work on over at [my
homepage](http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm).  Please don't send email to
my personal address when a mailing list or bugtracker would be more
appropriate.

I am not speaking for [my employer](https://torproject.org/)
unless I specifically say otherwise. Nor am I speaking for past or
future versions of myself: I might change my opinions at any
time. Follow technical advice at your own risk. This site is currently
hosted at github pages, which doesn't do TLS; make your security
decisions accordingly.
